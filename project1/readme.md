| What are the domains of the individual criteria (discrete / continuous)? Note: in the case of continuous domains, specify the range of the criterion’s variability, in the case of others: list the values. What is the nature (gain / cost) of the individual criteria?                                                                                        | All criterions are continuous type. `Unemployment Rate` and `Inflation` are in range [0, 1], `Income Tax Rate` and `GINI` are in range [0, 100] and finally `Gross Domestic Product` and `Total Reserves` are unbounded |
| Are all criteria of equal importance (should they have the same ”weights”)? If not, can the relative importance of the criteria under consideration be expressed in terms of weights? In this case, estimate the weights of each criterion on a scale of 1 to 10. Are there any criteria among the criteria that are completely or almost invalid / irrelevant? | The importance and weights of the criteria are not specified in the question.                                                                                                                                           |
| Are there dominated alternatives among the considered data set?

| What should the theoretically best alternative look like in your opinion? Is it a small advantage on many criteria, or rather a strong advantage on few (but key) criteria?

| Which of the considered alternatives (provide name and values on individual criteria) seems to be the best / definitely better than the others? Is it determined by one reason (e.g. definitely the lowest price) or rather the overall value of the criteria? Does this alternative still have any weaknesses?                                                 | ???                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
